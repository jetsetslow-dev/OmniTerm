# Kotlin automation round — 2026-11-08

Scope (user request, Nov 7–8): review comparable open-source apps for missed bugs and features,
give OmniTerm a capability no other app has for homelab and server admins, re-check Quick Scripts
and Fleet after the cross-OS/container/Kubernetes work, add automation hooks (Tasker and similar
apps, an opt-in private MCP server), optional per-host WireGuard/Tailscale tunnels, credit every
project we learn from, then bring Flutter level with Kotlin. Branch `kotlin-automation` from main
after #136 and #137. Independent review and merge remain the user's.

The private audit (sources per finding, designs, order) is in the internal docs as
`COMPETITOR_AUDIT_2026-11-08.md`.

## Checkpoint A — scripts and Fleet defects (this commit)

- Script values: `{{name}}` and `{{name=default}}` in a saved script ask for a value when it runs
  from Monitor → Scripts or Fleet. Values are quoted for each host's shell (POSIX single quotes;
  Windows double quotes, refusing `" % ! $ \`` and line breaks), so a value is always one word.
  Shared code: `data/ScriptParams.kt`, `ui/ScriptParamsDialog.kt`. Credit: Semaphore UI.
- Proxmox presets: "start VM" and "shut down VM" ask for the VM id (they ran `qm start 100` /
  `qm stop 100`); shutdown is `qm shutdown`. Untouched stored copies of retired presets are moved to
  the current ones at startup (`retiredPresetScripts`); edited copies are left alone.
- Fleet honours a picked preset's target OS/system: hosts known not to match are skipped and named
  in the confirmation; none matching shows "No host matches". Unprobed hosts are tried. The target
  fields in the script editor now apply to Fleet too.
- Fleet's command field is multi-line. As a single-line field, Enter could not add a line break and a
  pasted script showed as one long line (it still ran as written). Credit: ssh-mcp.
- Broken fallbacks: "Syslog errors" never reached `/var/log` when `logread` was missing (pipeline
  status is the last command's); "Updates available" never reached dnf and reported dnf's exit 100
  as failure. Both now test for each tool; updates cover apt, dnf, yum, zypper, pacman, apk, pkg.
- Danger warning: adds ZFS/LVM/mdadm, container prunes and `compose down -v`, `kubectl
  delete|drain`, `helm uninstall`, `qm|pct destroy|stop`, `find -delete`, `crontab -r`, SSH
  lock-outs (stop/disable sshd, `ufw enable`, INPUT DROP), and Windows deletes/formats/restarts.
  `qm shutdown` no longer reads as a host shutdown.
- Windows output is UTF-8 (`RemoteCommands.POWERSHELL_PRELUDE`). Credit: Termix, ssh-mcp-server.
- SSH banners: kept by `KeyboardInteractiveUserInfo.showMessage` and printed at the top of a new
  terminal session after removing control characters (`bannerForTerminal`).
- Monitor → Scripts "Save" now keeps the notes field (it was dropped).
- README: Terminal, Fleet, Scripts and Acknowledgements; NOTICE: acknowledgements.
- Dependency updates the gate required (taken here rather than as Dependabot PRs): AGP 9.5.1,
  Gradle wrapper 9.9.0 (distribution and wrapper-jar SHA-256 match services.gradle.org), biometric
  1.4.0-beta01, mockk 1.14.12, Roborazzi 1.78.0, UI Automator 2.4.1, actions/setup-java 6.2.0,
  github/codeql-action 4.39.3 (bundles CLI 2.27.4, so the local CodeQL pin is unchanged).
  Checksums via `scripts/refresh-verification-metadata.sh --write`; the Actions allowlist check
  passes.

## Remaining, in order

1. Runbooks: rolling Fleet runs (batch size, stop on failure), retry failed hosts, export and run
   history, per-OS variants, wider platform detection (podman, k3s/microk8s, Synology, TrueNAS,
   Unraid).
2. Alerts: host offline/online, phone-offline guard for probes and endpoint checks, failed systemd
   units, unhealthy/exited containers, script-check rules; runbooks offered from alert
   notifications.
3. Automation: token-guarded Tasker/Locale plugin and broadcast to run a saved script or runbook,
   `ssh://` links, share target, one-tap public-key install.
4. MCP: opt-in, loopback only, reached through an SSH reverse tunnel, read-only by default,
   on-phone approval for writes, audit log, `PRIVACY.md` section.
5. Per-host WireGuard/Tailscale: blocked on a toolchain decision (needs Go; host installs are not
   allowed without the user's approval).
6. Flutter: one sync that merges main and ports #131, #132, #136, #137 and this round.

## Validation

Commands (run from the repository root):

- `./scripts/local-pr-check.sh --full` before every push, plus `git diff --check` and
  `git diff --cached --check`.
- New unit tests: `ScriptParamsTest`, `ScriptTargetsTest`, `SshBannerTest`; extended
  `CommandDangerHitsTest`; `CrossShellCommandsTest` and `HostOsCommandsTest` follow the prelude.
- Device (API 35, repository Docker fixture via `./scripts/test-hosts.sh up`): provision with
  `E2eLabHostProvisioner` (`omniterm_e2e_provision_host=yes`, `omniterm_e2e_trust_host=yes`), then
  `E2eScriptParamsFleetTest` with `-e omniterm_e2e_script_params yes`.

Results so far:
- The eight affected unit classes pass locally (68 tests, 0 failures).
- API 35 against the repository fixture: `E2eLabHostProvisioner` 2 passed, `E2eScriptParamsFleetTest`
  1 passed (multi-line command typed with Enter, `{{msg}}` value `it's; echo INJECTED` arrives as
  one word, a Windows-only preset leaves the Linux host out). With the old single-line field it
  fails at the typed line break, as expected.
- `./scripts/local-pr-check.sh --full` passed on the final tree: both unit variants, five extra
  runs of the six changed test classes, both lint gates, strict dependency verification, no
  advisories, no outstanding updates (66 Gradle, 36 Actions), secret scan, no new duplicate code,
  the API 35 device matrix, and local CodeQL 2.27.4 with zero alerts (76,475 lines). The CodeQL
  step's clean build removed the per-test result files, so this record has no per-test counts.
- CI: pending (PR not yet opened).

## Known exclusions

- Tunnels need a userspace WireGuard/TCP stack; every maintained one is Go (wireguard-go, tsnet).
- ChatGPT's local MCP support could not be verified (its docs returned 404); not claimed.
